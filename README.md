# hof-app - Higher-Order Functions Application
A simple application to dive into magic world of functional programming with C#
C# supports higher-order functions from the beginning - functions can be passed as a parameters to other functions or can be returned from the function as a result.

Here I just want to get principles of using of higher-order functions. It's just a test/demo/lerning app
